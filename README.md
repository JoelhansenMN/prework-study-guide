# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This study guide was created for bootcamp students who were going through the prework process prior to starting the bootcamp to familiarize themselves with coding.  It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  This webpage was built to help individuals new to coding begin to familiarize themselves with this process.  The learning was new and challenging at times and also very exciting and interesting!
